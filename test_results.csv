Your food is at risk as cold + hot food + glass bottle wine is being carried on motorbikes, pays penny for delivery of expensive food.\n\nAll delivery partners should stay away from taking up any orders from this restaurant. Pays peanuts for delivery and wants to claim back $11 delivery fee even though I informed ETA 15 minutes \u0026 offered to return back if he can't accept but he still insist that I should deliver.\n\nFULL STORY\nThere is this male Chinese staff who ordered lalamove courier (motorcycle) delivery from this dining restaurant for collection on 18 August 2024  after 12 midnight after restaurant closed. When I was on my way to collect, I communicated with him on Lalamove app to check if the order is confirmed and i asked what items to carry. He mentioned food and a bottle of glass wine. But he did not tell me of full details that there are many things to carry.\n\nTotal there are 4 food bags (there is hot food as well cold food to be separated and 1 glass wine) which exceeded size of what courier can carry. He should be ordering a car instead which it would cost more for delivery.\n\nWhen I reached the restaurant, it is already closed and he was standing at roadside. He did not tell me this, took up some extra time to find him. Then half way during the delivery around 45 mins, he called multiple times and I told him will reach destination in 15 mins or less. He ignored and continued to talk a long time to me on the phone which distracted me while I am driving which slowed down the delivery time, he says I should deliver straight away upon pick up and tells me his food is very expensive worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nI told him he should put his request in the delivery remarks upfront of cold food + hot food 4 bags + bottle of wine when placing order + require immediate delivery (no additional stops) then I will not take his order. Also I said his food has too many bags and needs to carried separately due to hot food plus cold food, I already doing him a favor did not ask for tip to carry excessive bags. I offered to send everything back to him without charge since he is not happy and not willing to wait 15 minutes but he still insist I deliver to customer instead of returning. He says he will complain to lalamove if his customer complain food spoilt. I told him I pack his food into 2 separated thermal bags (hot 1 bag cold 1 bag) upon receiving not to worry. He did not even thank me for it.\n\nAlso delivery address is a security tie condominium I needed time to wait for security to record details, let me enter and press access code to go up lift. This alone took me extra 15-20 mins. His customer (Receipient) of food items did not say anything when I delivered.\n\nIn the end this male Chinese staff complained to lalamove support for the slight delay of approximately 15 mins to claim back the delivery fee that is only $11.25 for about 15km travelling distance.\n\nThis restaurant is not fair and very stingy towards his delivery partners and even attempt to claim for compensation for slight delivery delay. His food plus wine cost hundreds but shortchanged by calling for the cheapest delivery method - courier (motorcycle), wants fast immediate delivery for multiple bags hot food + cold food + bottle of wine but pays only little money. Then he attempts to claim back for delivery fee. Very cheapskate restaurant. This is hard earn money, since he insist I should still deliver, he should not attempt to claim compensation for slight delay in delivery.\n\nTotally not recommended to take up any delivery jobs from this restaurant. All riders and drivers should stay away as he will create more issues to other riders taking advantage of us over items exceeded and rush before time due, distracting drivers concentrating on the road to slow us down further.\n\nI attached the delivery log as evidence of this did take place."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sAF1QipOrpKL2s4zBsT_zbOg26A6WRjX7d9zARg0d2MmP""],""When"":""2024-8-26""},{""Name"":""Shannon Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLz0rC3Ug_V0Tfbe_enp3oelyqpYkCsD1zjUu7JC67ro6QrvQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Amazing food and ambience. A cosy place with really good service. Ordered from the recommendations of the day which is not on the standard menu.

We enjoyed every bite of every dish, it was a really delightful experience, especially when paired with their excellent wine selection.\n\nI must also complement them on their amazing service. Went there for my girlfriend's birthday, and they offered to add some lovely chocolate writing for our dessert. They were very attentive and polite throughout the entire dinner, filling our glasses and clearing each course for the next item.\n\nTo the waiters and chefs of Wabi-Sabi: you all are amazing!
